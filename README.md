# Finding Pipe Pressures in a Hydraulic System

Given the diameters of hydraulic pipes in a system and their relationships to each other, as well
as the pressure at a given point, this program will find the pressures in every pipe according to
Bernoulli's principle. This model assumes the pump provides constant flow regardless of pressure,
and assumes all pipes are at the same elevation.
